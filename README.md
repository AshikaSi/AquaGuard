# AquaGuard - Simulated IoT-Based Water Management System

## 🌊 Overview
AquaGuard is a **simulated IoT-based water management system** that collects and analyzes virtual sensor data to optimize water usage and detect inefficiencies. By leveraging **data analytics and visualization**, the system provides real-time insights into water flow, pressure, and temperature to predict **leakages and potential system failures**.

## 🔥 Features
- **Simulated IoT Sensors**: Generates virtual sensor data for water flow rate, pressure, and temperature.
- **Leak Detection & Alerts**: Predicts leaks and inefficiencies based on analyzed trends.
- **Graph Analysis & Data Visualization**: Uses charts to display real-time sensor data and insights.
- **Smart Recommendations**: Provides actionable insights to improve water system efficiency.
- **Web Dashboard**: Built with **React.js & Chart.js**, offering an intuitive interface for monitoring data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React.js, Chart.js
- **Backend**: Python, Flask 
- **Data Analysis**: NumPy, Matplotlib

## 📊 How It Works
1. **Simulates sensor data** over time, including water flow, pressure, and temperature.
2. **Analyzes trends** using Python libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib.
3. **Visualizes data** through an interactive web dashboard.
4. **Detects inefficiencies and leak probabilities**, alerting users with recommendations.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Real-time data integration with physical IoT sensors.
- Advanced machine learning models for more accurate leak detection.
- Mobile app integration for remote monitoring.
